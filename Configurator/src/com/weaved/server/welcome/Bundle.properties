Once you feed a substantial amount of data to WeaveD, it is possible to extract cluster information from data as well as how patterns changed over time. \nYou can deploy WeaveD in your domain, simply by configuring few settings. WeaveD can benefit you immensely in domains such as finance, forensics, medicine, etc. \nOnce you open WeaveD for the first time, WeaveD will automatically take you through the configuration process. Once you complete the configuration process, WeaveD will take it on from there, and acquire knowledge from the provided data.\n\nPerception Hierarchy\nYou have to create a perception hierarchy,\n    </p>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n
